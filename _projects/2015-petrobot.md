Started as a workshop idea for the local makerfaire, the pet robot project is supposed to enable children and adults alike to learn about robotics, Arduino, programming, and making in general. The robot acts as a development and learning platform, to not just stand on a shelf and collect dust after being built in an organized workshop.

The project is completely open source, with design files and source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/tiefpunkt/petrobot). Documentation is still in progress, but also [online already](https://tiefpunkt.github.io/petrobot/).

We observed quite a lot of interest in the project at Make Munich 2017, so we're planning to continue our work on it and have more workshops within the community.
