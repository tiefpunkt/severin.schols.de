The PirateJukeBox is a wifi controlled music player, housed in an old ghettoblaster. It takes the PirateBox idea one step further by letting people play music, add their own music, or grab what’s currently playing using a wifi access point.

I used a RaspberryPi together with a USB Wifi stick, and fitted them inside the old boombox, onto which I soldered an internal 3,5mm audio connector. On the Pi, there’s the original PirateBox software running, alongside with an MPD server, that can be controlled from any laptop or mobile device.

There were plans to make it portable, but til this day, it has to be powered from mains power.
