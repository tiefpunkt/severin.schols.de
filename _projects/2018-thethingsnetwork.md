# The Things Network Munich

A local chapter of the global *The Things Network* initiative, the TTN Munich community seeks to build a free and open IoT network in the greater Munich area, ontop of the LoRaWAN standard. The LoRaWAN protocol allows for low-power long-range sensor communication in license-free ISM bands, enabling a network that can exist outside of power-hungry WiFi and expensive GSM/3G technologies.

The TTN Munich community meets up regularly, usually once a month, and in addition provides workshops for people interested in building their own network infrastructure, LoRaWAN senors and actors, as well as applications on top of that.
