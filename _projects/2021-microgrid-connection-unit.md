# Microgrid Connection Unit

A connection box that allows easily connect your own solar system to a micro grid of other similar systems. The MicroGrid Connection Unit should ensure the safety of your own system, adapt to the specifics of the microgrid in question, and allow for monitoring and statistics. This came out of the general DC MicroGrid project, and was pushed into existence as part of the Design for a Cause 2021 challenge by Element14.
