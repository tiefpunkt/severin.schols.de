# DC Microgrid

A smallscale powergrid using low voltage DC (12V & 48V). Initially dreamed up at CCCamp 2015, and prototyped by the altpwr team at SHA2017, this version of the microgrid idea came into existence in preparation to CCCamp 2019, with the idea to connect small solar (or other regenerative energy sources) setups with each other and offer power services to other users without means to generate their own energy.

Specific modules can be plugged into existing solar setups, and allow them to be connected to each other. These modules should not only ensure the safety of the individual systems, but also provide measurements to monitor the performance of the grid.

The plan is to make these modules available as kits so people can build their own and run their own microgrids.
