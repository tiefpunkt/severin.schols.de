# MatrixMix 4x4 Matrix Audio Mixer

The MatrixMix 4x4 is a passive 4x4 matrix audio mixer that can be daisy-chained.

When playing around with DIY synthesizers, I realized I needed a mixer to combine all the sounds together, and also integrate some effect loops. Especially for those effects, a matrix mixer comes in handy. So I designed one.
