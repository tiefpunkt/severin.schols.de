The other day, I was rambling on Twitter about needing to share my work, putting my self out there, partially because I had starte to read "Show your work" by Austin Kleon.

<div class="is-center">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Where and how? Probably here, and other platforms, maybe a newsletter, maybe a blog? I&#39;ve been working on different redesigns of my website for the past few months, but it hasn&#39;t gone anywhere I&#39;d feel good about, really. Almost at the point to pay for something like squarespace</p>&mdash; Severin (@tiefpunkt) <a href="https://twitter.com/tiefpunkt/status/1080193849128116224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 1, 2019</a></blockquote>

As mentioned, I've had the design for this website in the digital drawer for a while, but never quite finished it. Part of that was because I wanted to integrate the content from my older blog(s) as well, which turned out to be quite hard.

Also, there have been so many projects I had worked on over the past few years that putting them all in here with some proper documentation or at least a small paragraph seemed almost impossible.

Well, now here we are. I'm putting myself out there (or rather here) right now. I don't have all projects properly documented, and there are some quirks to the design I'm not quite happy with. So expect stuff to change. But it's a start, and that seemed necessary.

While working on this today, I took some time to get some other things I rambled about in those tweets in place. So if you are interested in hearing from me via email every once in a while, <a href="http://eepurl.com/gc3aw9">sign up to my newsletter</a>. And if you like what I've been up to so far, and want me to do more of that, you can <a href="https://www.paypal.me/tiefpunkt/3,2">buy me a cup of tea</a>, and I'll be super thankful for that.
